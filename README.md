# UCL_DSML_notebook
* This respository is used to store the notes of Data Science and Machine Learning courses at UCL
* The courses including
  * Supervosed Learning
  * Statistical Natural Language Processing
  
  etc.
* The notes will be updated every week or maybe every day. Depends on the weather and the traffic in London LOL
* As Latex equations can display in Github, the pdf files will be export and uploaded to the repository as well. But it may delay sometimes. I will try my best to upload .md and .pdf simultaneously.
* I wish you will enjoy them.
